title: "Functions"

Functions are the bread and butter and JavaScript.  JavaScript is more 'functional' than it is 'object-oriented'. (Please don't @ me on Twitter about this statement).

Functions are blocks of code that wrapped up and called on later.

```javascript
// Function Declaration, to be called later
function scream (string) {
  string = string.toUpperCase() + "!!!"
  console.log(string)
}

scream('theres always money in the banana stand')
// => THERES ALWAYS MONEY IN THE BANANA STAND!!!

// Function Expressions, aka storing a function as a variable
const yell = function (string) {
  string = string.toUpperCase() + '!'
  console.log(string)
}
yell('theres always money in the banana stand')
// => THERES ALWAYS MONEY IN THE BANANA STAND!


// ES6 arrow function expressions
// Single line arrow functions implicitly return
const whisper = (string) => string.toLowerCase() + '.'
console.log(whisper('THERES ALWAYS MONEY IN THE BANANA STAND'))
// => theres always money in the banana stand.

// Multiline Arrow Function expressions need a return statement
const insideVoices = (string) => {
  string = string.toLowerCase() + '.'
  return string
}
console.log(insideVoices('theres always money in the banana stand'))
// => theres always money in the banana stand.
```

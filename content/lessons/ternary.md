title: 'Ternary'
---
In JavaScript you can use a ternary statment in place of an 'If/Else'.

```javascript
console.log(7 % 2 === 0 ? '7 is even' : '7 is odd')

const isBlue = true;
console.log(isBlue ? 'Ive never seen a blue duck before.' : 'Standard duck')
```

```
$node jsbyexample.js
7 is odd
I've never seen a blue duck before.
```
